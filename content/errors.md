No matter how much you test, realistically your applications are going to have bugs. How you respond to these bugs once they occur is the key to reliability. Error tracking tools **capture exceptions** in your **runtime code** and provide context to help you **prioritize and investigate** them.

Log files provide general-purpose visibility, but too often errors pass by unnoticed or unhandled. Error tracking tools focus on **actionability**. They bubble up **frequent errors**, alert you in realtime on **new error types**, and help you **collaborate** on their resolution.


## Common Features

* Monitor exceptions in backend & frontend code
* Sort errors by frequency and severity
* Automatically group duplicate exceptions
* Alerts via Email, SMS, etc.
* Assign and track error resolution
